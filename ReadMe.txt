This is a test task for the position of software developer.

VideosWebAPI - API to manage mp4 files (upload, browse, stream)
VideosWebUI - UI for the above API mp4 files (upload, list, play)

Both solutions are .NET Core ASP.NET MVC (.NET 6) and should work locally.

How to run:
- Run API first.
- To configure the UI, update BaseApiUri parameter in appsettings.json in the root of the UI project.
  It must point to the API and have format like in this sample: "https://localhost:7179/"

The functionality required in the task description is not fully implemented because of lack of time.
